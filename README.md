# PySketches

### How To:

Use the arrow keys to move the sketcher.

`Z` will pull your pen off the canvas so you can move around the canvas without drawing.

`X` puts the pen back on the canvas to continue drawing.

`C` randomly changes the color.

`G` changes the color of the background to a gray.

`E` changes the color of the background to a white.

`Space` will clear the canvas.

Clicking on the canvas will exit the program.
